\title{Selecting variables for several subset sizes}
\usage{
qselection(x, y, qvector, criterion = "deviance", method = "lm",
  family = "gaussian")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing all the covariates.}

\item{y}{A vector with the response values.}

\item{qvector}{A vector with more than one variable-subset size to be
selected.}

\item{criterion}{The cross-validation-based information criterion to be used.
Default is the deviance. Other functions provided are the coefficient of
determination (\code{"R2"}) and residual variance (\code{"variance"}).}

\item{method}{A character string specifying which regression method is used,
i.e., linear models (\code{"lm"}), generalized additive models
(\code{"glm"}) or generalized additive models (\code{"gam"}).}

\item{family}{A description of the error distribution and link function to be
used in the model: (\code{"gaussian"}), (\code{"binomial"}) or
(\code{"poisson"}).}
}
\value{
\item{q}{A vector of subset sizes.} \item{criterion }{A vector of
Information criterion values.} \item{selection }{Selected variables for each
size.}
}
\description{
Function that enables to obtain the best variables for more than
 one size of subset. Returns a table with the chosen covariates to be
 introduced into the models and their information criteria.
